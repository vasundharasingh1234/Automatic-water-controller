# Automatic Water Level Controller

## 📌 Project Description
The Automatic Water Level Controller is a hardware-based project designed to automatically control the water pump based on the water level in the tank.  
It helps in preventing water overflow, saving electricity, and reducing manual effort.

This project is suitable for homes, apartments, and small industrial applications.

## ❓ Problem Statement
In many households, water pumps are operated manually, which often leads to water overflow and wastage.  
This project solves the problem by automatically switching the motor ON and OFF depending on the water level.

## ✨ Features
- Automatically turns ON the motor when water level is low  
- Automatically turns OFF the motor when the tank is full  
- Prevents water overflow  
- Saves water and electricity  
- Simple, low-cost, and reliable system

## 🛠 Components Used
- Water Level Sensors  
- Arduino UNO (Microcontroller)  
- Relay Module  
- DC Water Pump / Motor  
- Power Supply  
- Connecting Wires

## ⚙️ Working Principle
Water level sensors are placed at different levels inside the water tank.  
These sensors continuously monitor the water level and send signals to the microcontroller.

- When the water level goes below the minimum level, the microcontroller activates the relay and turns ON the motor.
- When the water reaches the maximum level, the motor is automatically turned OFF.

This process works continuously without any manual intervention.
